Addition of LiDAR Sensor for Enhanced Navigation:

Proof of Concept:

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) can significantly improve the robot's navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities. By emitting laser beams and measuring the time it takes for them to return after hitting an object, the robot can create a detailed map of its surroundings.

Implementation Steps:

Integrate LiDAR Sensor: Attach the LiDAR sensor to the front of the robot.
Sensor Fusion: Combine LiDAR data with gyroscope and accelerometer data.
Algorithm Development: Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to create and update maps in real-time.
Obstacle Avoidance: Program the robot to navigate around obstacles using the LiDAR data.
