The core concept of a TWSBR is to maintain balance using dynamic stabilization. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the position of the wheels based on feedback from sensors. Key components include:

Gyroscope: Measures angular velocity.
Accelerometer: Measures acceleration and tilt.
Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls the motors.
Motors and Wheels: Actuators that adjust the robot's position.
