Programming the Robot:

The robot will be programmed to navigate to the consumer's doorstep, avoiding obstacles and traffic. Key steps include:

Mapping and Localization: Using LiDAR and other sensors to map the environment.
Path Planning: Implementing algorithms like A* or Dijkstra for optimal pathfinding.
Motor Control: Using PID controllers for precise motor control to maintain balance.
Obstacle Avoidance: Dynamic adjustment of the path using real-time sensor data.
