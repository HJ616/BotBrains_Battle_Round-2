Parameters to consider:

Center of Gravity (CoG): The position of the CoG affects the robot's stability.
Wheelbase Width: The distance between the wheels impacts the balance.
Height of the Robot: Taller robots are more prone to tipping.
Weight Distribution: Uniform weight distribution helps in maintaining balance.
Motor Torque: Sufficient torque is needed to correct imbalances.
Surface Friction: Affects the grip of the wheels and balance.
Speed of Movement: Higher speeds can lead to instability.
Incline Angle: The angle of the surface the robot is operating on.
