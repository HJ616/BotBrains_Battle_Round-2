Concepts and Ideas
Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robots (TWSBR):

A TWSBR relies on the principles of dynamic stabilization. This means it uses continuous feedback from its sensors to adjust its position and maintain balance. The main components of a TWSBR include:

Sensors:
Gyroscope: Measures the robot's angular velocity.
Accelerometer: Measures linear acceleration and helps in detecting tilt.
Microcontroller:
Processes sensor data.
Executes control algorithms.
Sends commands to the motors.
Motors:
Control the wheels' movement to maintain balance and navigate.
Battery:
Provides power to all components.
Control Algorithms:

The primary control algorithm used in TWSBRs is the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.
